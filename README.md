do your best AI !! - lol

# üöÄ Welcome to my Next.js Project! üöÄ

This is the home of my Next.js project, which is also mirrored over at my JetBrains Space repo, for **MY** viewing pleasure at [this cool link](https://elluiscodes.jetbrains.space/p/main/repositories/elluis-next-main/files/main). Let's take a tour of the tech stack, in the order of implementation!

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ [Next.js](https://www.nextjs.org)
We kick things off with Next.js, the React framework. It's the backbone, the heart, the **soul** of our application! (Not to mention it gives us server-side rendering and static web applications)„Äê9‚Ä†source„Äë.

### ‚û°Ô∏è [NextAuth.js](https://www.next-auth.js.org)
But wait, we need some security! Enter NextAuth.js. Handles authentication like a champ. Supports JWT, OAuth and more. It's like the bouncer at the door of our app!„Äê13‚Ä†source„Äë.

### ‚û°Ô∏è [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io)
Next up, Prisma. Our trusty sidekick for managing data. With its cool data model and automated migrations, refactoring is a breeze. It's like the Swiss Army knife for your database!„Äê17‚Ä†source„Äë.

### ‚û°Ô∏è [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org)
And for local development, we've got SQLite. Lightweight, self-contained, and it doesn't eat up too much space in your computer. Perfect for local development and testing!„Äê21‚Ä†source„Äë.

### ‚û°Ô∏è [Tailwind CSS](https://www.tailwindcss.com)
Ready to be dazzled by our app's style? Thank Tailwind CSS. It's the fairy godmother of our app's look and feel!„Äê25‚Ä†source„Äë.

### ‚û°Ô∏è [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
To keep our code clean and bug-free, we've got TypeScript. It's like the grammar police for our code, but in a good way!„Äê29‚Ä†source„Äë.

### ‚û°Ô∏è [Jest](https://www.jestjs.io)
And to make sure everything works as expected, we've got Jest. Like the little elves that test our app while we sleep!„Äê33‚Ä†source„Äë.

### ‚û°Ô∏è [MDX](https://www.mdxjs.com) and friends
For the best content experience, we've got MDX, next-contentlayer, and next-mdx-remote. It's like the dream team for creating, managing, and loading our content!„Äê37‚Ä†source„Äë„Äê38‚Ä†source„Äë„Äê42‚Ä†source„Äë„Äê46‚Ä†source„Äë.

### ‚û°Ô∏è [Chakra UI](https://www.chakra-ui.com)
For an accessible and modular UI, we've got Chakra UI. Like the interior decorator for our app's user interface!„Äê50‚Ä†source„Äë.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ [ESLint](https://www.eslint.org)
To keep our code squeaky clean and bug-free, we've got ESLint. It's like the housekeeper of our codebase!„Äê54‚Ä†source„Äë.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ [Prettier](https://www.prettier.io)
For a consistent code style, we've got Prettier. It's like the stylist of our codebase, keeping it sleek and readable!„Äê58‚Ä†source„Äë.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky)
